Eligibility
To qualify for admission to the Master of International Trade Law and Economics, you must have earned your bachelor's degree in any field, within or outside of the United States, by the time you enroll at USC Gould School of Law. Students are required to have a solid foundation in mathematics at the university level, including calculus. If you hold a degree from a university within the United States, USC Graduate Admissions requires that it must be a regionally accredited institution.
If you are currently earning your degree and will complete it prior to the start of your studies, you may be admitted, but will be required to complete certain continuing registration requirements. You must submit official final transcripts showing your degree was awarded before you may begin your studies.
We do not require work experience or an LSAT or a GRE score to be considered for admission to any of our graduate degrees. Should you elect to submit an LSAT or GRE score report to supplement your application, such score will not play a key role in our admission decision-making process to ensure an equitable process for all applicants.

As a courtesy and to help applicants offset this cost, we have waived the USC Gould School of Law's separate application fee for applicants who submit their applications prior to our priority deadline.
Among the required information and documents that you will submit through LSAC are:
1. Online LSAC Application
2. Official Transcripts and Degree Verification:
Applicants must have earned their bachelor's degree by the time they enroll at USC Gould School of Law. No law degree is required. See a country-by-country breakdown of our requirements.
You are required to submit your official transcripts through the LSAC Credential Assembly Service. Transcripts must be evaluated through LSAC's International Transcript Authentication and Evaluation Service (ITAES). You will need to subscribe to the following LSAC services:
* Document Assembly Service: $94
* International Transcript Authentication and Evaluation Service (ITAES): $140
* Law School Report: $34
Transcripts must be submitted directly to LSAC by the university and should not be mailed to USC Gould School of Law. LSAC provides detailed instructions on submitting your transcripts.
3. Personal Statement:
Provide a two or three-page document that includes your personal, academic, and professional background and your reasons for pursuing an ADR certificate. If you have prior education or experience in alternative dispute resolution, please take a paragraph or two to tell us about it.
4. Resume/Curriculum Vitae:
Provide a record of your employment history and list any distinctions, publications, and licenses/credentials.

Please refer to the LSAC Checklist for instructions on the LLM application process. If you experience technical issues with your application, contact LSAC for assistance at 215-968-1315 or llminfo@lsac.org.
We highly recommend that you only submit one application to the degree of most interest to you. We would be happy to consider you for one of our other degrees. Once you have submitted your application to your first-choice program, please email gipadmissions@law.usc.edu to let us know you have applied and to indicate any additional degree for which you would like to be considered.
Among the required information and documents you will submit through LSAC are:
* transcripts and degree verification
* a two- to three-page statement that describes your personal, academic and professional background, and your reasons for applying
* a résumé or curriculum vitae
* TOEFL or IELTS report (no minimum score is required)
   * Have your official test scores sent to LSAC if you submit your application through LSAC. LSAC's institutional code is 8395.
   * Test scores must be dated within two years (24 months) of the application date.
   * TOEFL or IELTS waivers may be granted in accordance with the USC Graduate Admissions Policy; if you feel you should be allowed to waive this requirement, please submit your waiver request as an attachment to your application.
   * USC does NOT accept MyBest TOEFL scores of applicants as valid proof of language proficiency. We will consider the single best total TOEFL or IELTS score you submit along with the sub-scores from that test.
Letters of recommendation are not required, but we will accept up to two letters of recommendation at gipadmissions@law.usc.edu.
For your convenience and to streamline the application process, USC Gould requires prospective students to use LSAC's Document Assembly Service and International Transcript Authentication and Evaluation Service, which allows you to apply to multiple law schools while submitting only one set of materials. Credential evaluation takes 2-3 weeks to complete once LSAC has received all of your documents; there may be further delay during LSAC's peak processing periods or if LSAC determines that additional information is required to complete its review. We therefore suggest that you apply as early as possible so that there is no consequential delay in LSAC transmitting its evaluation report to us.
Application Status Check
After you submit your application through LSAC, we will send you a confirmation email that provides you with a username and password for the Application Online Status Check system. Then you may log in and create a new, personalized password and periodically check your application status.
Admission Decisions
Admissions decisions are made upon receipt of complete application files. Incomplete applications are not reviewed. We encourage you to apply by our Priority Deadline to provide sufficient time for you to complete your application file. Our Admissions Committee will provide admissions decisions generally within 2-3 weeks upon our receipt of completed applications, beginning in January for Fall semester start and beginning in July for Spring semester start. You will be notified via email and postal mail. No admissions decisions will be released over the phone. We will contact you if the Admissions Committee recommends an interview or additional submissions.
Financial Statement
If you are admitted, you will be required to provide a financial statement that certifies that you have sufficient funds available to meet your living (housing, meals, etc.) and tuition expenses while at USC (unless you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, or have been granted political asylum). At that time, you also must submit a copy of the photo page of your passport (and passport copies of any dependent(s) traveling with you).

You will be notified via email and postal mail. No admissions decisions will be released over the phone. We will contact you if the Admissions Committee recommends an interview or additional submissions.
Financial Statement
If you are admitted, you will be required to provide a financial statement that certifies that you have sufficient funds available to meet your living (housing, meals, etc.) and tuition expenses while at USC (unless you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, or have been granted political asylum). At that time, you also must submit a copy of the photo page of your passport (and passport copies of any dependent(s) traveling with you).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
Please refer to the LSAC Checklist for instructions on the LLM application process. If you experience technical issues with your application, contact LSAC for assistance at 215-968-1315 or llminfo@lsac.org.
We highly recommend that you only submit one application to the degree of most interest to you. We would be happy to consider you for one of our other degrees. Once you have submitted your application to your first-choice program, please email gipadmissions@law.usc.edu to let us know you have applied and to indicate any additional degree for which you would like to be considered.
Among the required information and documents you will submit through LSAC are:
* transcripts and degree verification
* a two- to three-page statement that describes your personal, academic and professional background, and your reasons for applying
* a résumé or curriculum vitae
* TOEFL or IELTS report (no minimum score is required)
   * Have your official test scores sent to LSAC if you submit your application through LSAC. LSAC's institutional code is 8395.
   * Test scores must be dated within two years (24 months) of the application date.
   * TOEFL or IELTS waivers may be granted in accordance with the USC Graduate Admissions Policy; if you feel you should be allowed to waive this requirement, please submit your waiver request as an attachment to your application.
   * USC does NOT accept MyBest TOEFL scores of applicants as valid proof of language proficiency. We will consider the single best total TOEFL or IELTS score you submit along with the sub-scores from that test.
Letters of recommendation are not required, but we will accept up to two letters of recommendation at gipadmissions@law.usc.edu.
For your convenience and to streamline the application process, USC Gould requires prospective students to use LSAC's Document Assembly Service and International Transcript Authentication and Evaluation Service, which allows you to apply to multiple law schools while submitting only one set of materials. Credential evaluation takes 2-3 weeks to complete once LSAC has received all of your documents; there may be further delay during LSAC's peak processing periods or if LSAC determines that additional information is required to complete its review. We therefore suggest that you apply as early as possible so that there is no consequential delay in LSAC transmitting its evaluation report to us.
Application Status Check
After you submit your application through LSAC, we will send you a confirmation email that provides you with a username and password for the Application Online Status Check system. Then you may log in and create a new, personalized password and periodically check your application status.
Admission Decisions
Admissions decisions are made upon receipt of complete application files. Incomplete applications are not reviewed. We encourage you to apply by our Priority Deadline to provide sufficient time for you to complete your application file. Our Admissions Committee will provide admissions decisions generally within 2-3 weeks upon our receipt of completed applications, beginning in January for Fall semester start and beginning in July for Spring semester start. You will be notified via email and postal mail. No admissions decisions will be released over the phone. We will contact you if the Admissions Committee recommends an interview or additional submissions.

﻿Eligibility
To be eligible to apply, you must have earned or plan to earn a bachelor's degree before enrolling at USC Gould School of Law. If you hold a degree from a university within the United States, USC Graduate Admissions requires that it must be a regionally accredited institution. No degree or experience in law is required. We seek applicants whose academic background, professional aspirations, personal commitment, and communication skills align with the focus of USC Gould School of Law Center for Dispute Resolution and meet the demands of a rigorous legal graduate certificate program. While the university does not require a GPA minimum, our Admissions Committee will strongly consider those applicants who have earned an overall 3.0 (based on a 4.0 grading scale) or B average or higher. Our Admissions Committee will consider GPAs below our recommendation, provided that you meet our other admissions criteria.
We do not require work experience or an LSAT/GRE score to be considered for admission to any of our graduate degrees. Should you elect to submit an LSAT or GRE score report to supplement your application, such score will not play a key role in our admission decision-making process to ensure an equitable process for all applicants.
Note: Our MDR degree is not recommended for students intending to practice law. Pursuant to the American Bar Association Standards and USC's graduate transfer policies, credits earned in our MDR program are not eligible for transfer to a Juris Doctor (JD) program at USC or other universities. In addition, students in our MDR program are not eligible to apply for our LLM-JD Transfer program. For students who wish to become attorneys, we advise that they learn more about our JD degree.

We therefore suggest that you apply as early as possible so that there is no consequential delay in LSAC transmitting its evaluation report to us. Fees charged by LSAC for utilizing its services, including for ITAES, are payable to LSAC. Please visit LSAC's website for more information about fees charged by LSAC, including its refund policy. USC Gould requires a $75 application fee, which will be waived if you apply by our priority deadline.
