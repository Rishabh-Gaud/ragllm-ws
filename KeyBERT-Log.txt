Title: Magicoder: Source Code Is All You Need
published on PaperswithCode
Authors: Yuxiang Wei, Zhe Wang, Jiawei Liu, Yifeng Ding, Lingming Zhang
url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02120v1.pdf
We introduce Magicoder, a series of fully open-source (code, weights, and data)
Large Language Models (LLMs) for code that significantly closes the gap with top
code models while having no more than 7B parameters. Magicoder models are
trained on 75K synthetic instruction data using OSS-INSTRUCT, a novel approach
to enlightening LLMs with open-source code snippets to generate high-quality
instruction data for code. Our main motivation is to mitigate the inherent bias of
the synthetic data generated by LLMs by empowering them with a wealth of opensource references for the production of more diverse, realistic, and controllable
data. The orthogonality of OSS-INSTRUCT and other data generation methods
like Evol-Instruct further enables us to build an enhanced MagicoderS. Both
Magicoder and MagicoderS substantially outperform state-of-the-art code models
with similar or even larger sizes on a wide range of coding benchmarks, including
Python text-to-code generation, multilingual coding, and data-science program
completion. Notably, MagicoderS-CL-7B based on CODELLAMA even surpasses
the prominent ChatGPT on HumanEval+ (66.5 vs. 65.9 in pass@1). Overall,
OSS-INSTRUCT opens a new direction for low-bias and high-quality instruction
tuning using abundant open-source references.

Eligibility
To qualify for admission to the Master of International Trade Law and Economics, you must have earned your bachelor's degree in any field, within or outside of the United States, by the time you enroll at USC Gould School of Law. Students are required to have a solid foundation in mathematics at the university level, including calculus. If you hold a degree from a university within the United States, USC Graduate Admissions requires that it must be a regionally accredited institution.
If you are currently earning your degree and will complete it prior to the start of your studies, you may be admitted, but will be required to complete certain continuing registration requirements. You must submit official final transcripts showing your degree was awarded before you may begin your studies.
We do not require work experience or an LSAT or a GRE score to be considered for admission to any of our graduate degrees. Should you elect to submit an LSAT or GRE score report to supplement your application, such score will not play a key role in our admission decision-making process to ensure an equitable process for all applicants.

If you hold a degree from a university within the United States, USC Graduate Admissions requires that it must be a regionally accredited institution.
If you are currently earning your degree and will complete it prior to the start of your studies, you may be admitted, but will be required to complete certain continuing registration requirements. You must submit official final transcripts showing your degree was awarded before you may begin your studies.
We do not require work experience or an LSAT or a GRE score to be considered for admission to any of our graduate degrees. Should you elect to submit an LSAT or GRE score report to supplement your application, such score will not play a key role in our admission decision-making process to ensure an equitable process for all applicants.

Eligibility
To qualify for admission to the Master of International Trade Law and Economics, you must have earned your bachelor's degree in any field, within or outside of the United States, by the time you enroll at USC Gould School of Law. Students are required to have a solid foundation in mathematics at the university level, including calculus. If you hold a degree from a university within the United States, USC Graduate Admissions requires that it must be a regionally accredited institution.
If you are currently earning your degree and will complete it prior to the start of your studies, you may be admitted, but will be required to complete certain continuing registration requirements. You must submit official final transcripts showing your degree was awarded before you may begin your studies.
We do not require work experience or an LSAT or a GRE score to be considered for admission to any of our graduate degrees. Should you elect to submit an LSAT or GRE score report to supplement your application, such score will not play a key role in our admission decision-making process to ensure an equitable process for all applicants.

USC Gould School of Law offers two starts in fall and spring. Applications become available in September for Fall semester and in June for Spring semester. To receive priority consideration, apply by our Priority Deadline (see date below for each semester).

Eligibility
To qualify for admission to the Master of International Trade Law and Economics, you must have earned your bachelor's degree in any field, within or outside of the United States, by the time you enroll at USC Gould School of Law. Students are required to have a solid foundation in mathematics at the university level, including calculus. If you hold a degree from a university within the United States, USC Graduate Admissions requires that it must be a regionally accredited institution.
If you are currently earning your degree and will complete it prior to the start of your studies, you may be admitted, but will be required to complete certain continuing registration requirements. You must submit official final transcripts showing your degree was awarded before you may begin your studies.
We do not require work experience or an LSAT or a GRE score to be considered for admission to any of our graduate degrees. Should you elect to submit an LSAT or GRE score report to supplement your application, such score will not play a key role in our admission decision-making process to ensure an equitable process for all applicants.
Application Deadlines
USC Gould School of Law offers two starts in fall and spring. Applications become available in September for Fall semester and in June for Spring semester. To receive priority consideration, apply by our Priority Deadline (see date below for each semester).

Eligibility
To qualify for admission to the Master of International Trade Law and Economics, you must have earned your bachelor's degree in any field, within or outside of the United States, by the time you enroll at USC Gould School of Law. Students are required to have a solid foundation in mathematics at the university level, including calculus. If you hold a degree from a university within the United States, USC Graduate Admissions requires that it must be a regionally accredited institution.
If you are currently earning your degree and will complete it prior to the start of your studies, you may be admitted, but will be required to complete certain continuing registration requirements. You must submit official final transcripts showing your degree was awarded before you may begin your studies.
We do not require work experience or an LSAT or a GRE score to be considered for admission to any of our graduate degrees. Should you elect to submit an LSAT or GRE score report to supplement your application, such score will not play a key role in our admission decision-making process to ensure an equitable process for all applicants.
Application Deadlines
USC Gould School of Law offers two starts in fall and spring. Applications become available in September for Fall semester and in June for Spring semester. To receive priority consideration, apply by our Priority Deadline (see date below for each semester). After our Priority Deadline, applications will only be accepted on a rolling basis as space is available until the final application deadline.
Below are the start dates and application deadlines:
