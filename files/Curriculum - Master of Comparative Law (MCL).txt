Our scholarly yet practical approach ensures that you gain the skills and perspective every lawyer needs to practice, teach, enter public service or work in business.
You must complete a comparative law course and the MCL writing requirement through a Directed Research course. You will satisfy your remaining course requirements with electives of your choice. Course selection varies each semester depending on interest and availability.
In addition, you will attend classes and events with LLM and JD students, offering diverse perspectives and opportunities to get to know your peers — and future colleagues.
We can assist you with choosing courses that help prepare you to sit for the New York, California or District of Columbia (D.C.) bars. Prior to registration, our office of Graduate & International Programs will offer you guidance in determining which classes are needed to comply with bar and graduation requirements as well as meeting your specific interests and goals. See the Career and Bar page for more information.
