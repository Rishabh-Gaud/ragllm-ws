ADR as a First Career
Many MDR graduates pursue a first career in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Entry-level administrative positions requiring ADR skills and education, such as case managers and program administrators, can be found within a diverse set of employers, including federal and state governments, ADR service providers (both pro bono and for-profit), universities, and a growing number of law firms. Entry-level jobs involving ADR practice are rare and highly competitive.
Many of our graduates take an entrepreneurial approach to starting a career in ADR. The marketplace for private practice mediators and arbitrators is extremely competitive and requires the additional skill set of a small business owner. Our career workshops teach you the tools and strategies necessary to build a thriving practice as a professional neutral.
Pivoting Your Career to ADR
Our ADR programs may also open career opportunities by allowing you to pivot your career toward new roles in your chosen field. For example, someone working in the healthcare industry may pivot to a career as Healthcare Ombudsman/Mediator. Individuals working in business gain skills that will help them achieve leadership roles. Technology professionals could help design systems for the growing field of online dispute resolution (ODR).
Through our ADR coursework, you will be better equipped to:
* Advance into leadership positions
* Better understand your clients in business and therefore better serve their needs
* Work internationally with attorneys and neutrals in the rapidly expanding field of international ADR.
Our MDR prepares you for a unique range of opportunities that will allow you to reach your professional goals.
