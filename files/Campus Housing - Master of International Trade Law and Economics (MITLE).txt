USC Gould offers convenient, private, secure and fully furnished graduate student housing at a competitive monthly rate. Our housing complex is located close to campus, just a short walk from the law school. Family housing units also are available on a limited basis.
If you opt to live in university housing, you will enter into a 9-month contract, allowing you to move into your apartment in early August, a few weeks before the start of classes in the fall, and stay through our commencement ceremony in May. If you are a spring admitted student interested in USC campus housing, we recommend you reach out to us at MITLE@law.usc.edu prior to submitting a housing application.
View our housing flyer for more information about university housing.

Summer Housing
We offer separate summer housing if you enroll in our Summer Law and English (SLE) intensive. Review SLE Campus Housing for more information. If you applied for USC Housing for the LLM year, you will be able to transition into your apartment as units become ready in August.
