USC Gould offers convenient, private, secure and fully furnished graduate student housing at a competitive monthly rate. Our housing complex is located close to campus, just a short walk from the law school. Family housing units also are available on a limited basis.
If you opt to live in university housing, you will enter into a 9-month contract, allowing you to move into your apartment in early August, a few weeks before the start of classes in the fall, and stay through our commencement ceremony in May.
View our housing flyer for more information about university housing.
Graduate student housing is very limited for students entering in the spring but may be available. Admitted spring students may inquire with our office if they are interested in submitting a Housing application.
Housing Application
You can apply to live on USC campus housing by completing the housing application. If you will be enrolling in spring semester, please contact our USC Housing representative, Michelle Canlas at mcanlas@usc.edu.
Summer Housing
We offer separate summer housing if you enroll in our Summer Law and English (SLE) intensive. Review SLE Campus Housing for more information. If you applied for USC Housing for the LLM year, you will be able to transition into your apartment as units become ready in August.
Housing Stipends
Students who apply to our degree program by our priority deadline will be automatically considered for a housing stipend, which is awarded in varying amounts.
As with our merit scholarships, you do not need to submit a separate application to be eligible. Students may receive both a merit scholarship and a housing stipend.  Like merit scholarships, housing stipends are credited to student accounts and need not be used for campus housing.
