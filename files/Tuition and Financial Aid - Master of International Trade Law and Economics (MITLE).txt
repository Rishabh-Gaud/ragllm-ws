The FAFSA can be completed as early as October 1 of the year prior to the year in which you intend to enroll, and should be completed as early as possible. USC's school code is 001328.

Corporate Billing
USC students who are sponsored by a company; a local, state, federal, or international governmental agency; or branch of the U.S. military may be eligible to have all or a portion of their bills sent directly to the sponsor. Payment by the sponsor is due upon receipt of the bill. The charges paid by the sponsor can vary - some will pay for tuition and mandatory fees, others will also pay for parking, housing, dining, or other charges. The student is responsible for paying any charges not authorized by the agency. For more information on how to arrange for corporate billing visit the USC Agency Billing office.
Employer Reimbursement
USC students who receive tuition reimbursement from their employer have the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their tuition payment until the end of the semester. Students whose employers reimburse at the end of each semester rather than paying for tuition upfront should visit USC's Student Financial Services' website.
Veteran Benefits
USC students who are active duty military personnel and veterans may qualify for education benefits through various Veteran Affairs (VA) and State programs. Please visit VA Resource Center for details on available programs.
